                <p class="letter-text">
                   
                    Sayang, happiest birthday to you, baby!
                    Thank you for being born into this cruel world and making it a little brighter just by existing. 
                    You deserve nothing less than all the happiness (and wealth!) this universe has to offer.  
                    You are the answer to my prayers, the most precious gift I never knew I deserved. 
                    I’m endlessly grateful to your parents for raising such a perfect man—one who is kind, 
                    considerate, lovely, and, of course, irresistibly handsome. From the moment I first laid eyes on you, 
                    I was completely captivated. I’m so thankful I had the courage to tell people I liked you, 
                    to approach you, even when I thought you were far beyond my reach. 
                    And I will always be grateful to the Creator for allowing me to experience this kind of love—with you, only you.  
                    I hope our love continues to bloom, like a garden overflowing with magnificent flowers. 
                    I will love you endlessly, no matter what, and I promise to make sure that being with me brings you 
                    nothing but happiness for the rest of your life.  
                </p>
